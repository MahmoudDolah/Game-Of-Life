# HW4 - Shell                 
This is the leet hacker shell. It's only meant for true hackers.

All jokes aside, here's what I got.

## Completed
Here's what works             
1) Built-in commands - Handles cd and exit               
2) Command parsing               
3) Environment (however, this was not tested super thoroughly)

## Unfinished
1) I/O Redirection
- Look in the redirect function to see what I made for it

## Notes
So, as of this moment, the redirect function (the name of the function in my code that handles I/O redirection) is commented out (on line 53). For some reason, when that line is uncommented, the command entered in the terminal does not output to STDOUT.
Further testing is required.
